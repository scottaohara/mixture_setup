#Quick Mixture Project Setup

I like using Mixture to quickly get a static project started.

However, I don't need any of the boilerplates that come prepackaged
with it.

So here's my quick start files to drop in a nice empty Mixture project.

<hr />

I develop my projects using my own CSS framework, Brass Tacks:
https://github.com/scottaohara/Brass-Tacks

Give it a shot if you like. I'd appreciate the feedback.

<hr />

If you're using this w/out Brass Tacks, as that's a likely possibility,
you should make sure to edit the links to CSS files in the <code>&lt;head></code>
of layout.liquid.

Change them to whatever you call your project's main CSS file(s).
